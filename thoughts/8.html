                    <h6>
                        After everything I've been through in my 18 years, I've come to see my friend circle in a few different ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>'So-called friends'</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>'Just simple friends'</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>'Close friends'</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>'Best friends'</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Remember those moments when your parents assigned you a task, but your mind was elsewhere, lost in deep thought? They could sense something was off. You tried to focus, but your mind wandered, leading to mistakes. Then, the inevitable scolding followed.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>'So-called friends'</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        These are the friends who seem to be around only when they need something. Their interactions are usually self-centered, and our connection feels more like an obligation than a genuine bond.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>'Just simple friends'</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        These are the friends with whom I share casual conversations and occasional fun. We don't talk regularly, but when we do, it's pleasant. They offer help and advice when I ask, but our friendship doesn't go much deeper.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>'Close friends'</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        These are who guide me, advise me, and listen to me, and I do the same for them. We stick together through thick and thin, sharing both the ups and downs. Our interactions are frequent, and we enjoy regular fun activities and meaningful conversations. The fun part is that society often urges me to break the unique bond I have with these guys, simply because they disapprove of our closeness and want to disrupt our lives negatively.
                        <br><br>
                        The reason I can't merge these friends with my 'Best friends' is still unknown to me. Even though they have always been my 'Best friends' from day one, I can't quite figure out why I can be so open with them and reach out without hesitation. Perhaps it's the age gap, the experience gap, or something else I haven't discovered yet. Maybe I never will unless I continue being open with them. It feels like I'm stuck in a loop of trust and openness with these friends, but it's a loop I don't mind being in.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>'Best friends'</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Among my close friends, there's a special group I consider my best friends. They are more than just friends—they're like family, mentors, and well-wishers. They know every detail about me, including my ifs and buts, ups and downs, and why I'm sad or happy. I can be completely open with them and reach out without hesitation.
                        <br><br>
                        Through this journey, I've learned that friendship is not about categorizing or being biased. It's about recognizing the different roles people play in our lives and valuing each one for what they bring. Every friend, regardless of the category, holds a special place in my heart and contributes to my life in meaningful ways.
